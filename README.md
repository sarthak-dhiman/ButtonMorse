Morse is older binary communication method that uses dashes and dots to encode the data.
the goal of this project is to create a decoder that helps with visual and interactive learning of the learning.
the basic idea is to use two switches , to feed dots and dashes whilst the third switch can act as enter to denote the sequence 
of a single charachter has been entered and is ready to be decoded or act as a delete key if the user feels like the entered 
sequence is flawed
